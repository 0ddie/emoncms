This is where we will implement the register module so when a node connects it will automatically 
register to emoncms, it's Ip will be recorded in a MySQL database and it will be assigned a node ID.


Todo-
-Node initates a connection, emoncms saves IP to database. Maybe convert IP address to input then a feed using OEMan Attribute library code.
-Generate Node ID for new node (Nothing developed basically from scratch)
-Send Node ID back to node in correct format. 
-Node sends in the packet with the type of attribute. Register module needs to assign the attributes to the correct
Node ID and IP address and then make sure the next data recieved uses the feed module to post data to emoncms.
